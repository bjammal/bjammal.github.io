I started my career as a Network Engineer designing solution, configuring devices, and troubleshooting L2-L3, but higher layers networks as well. I hold several professional certifications like Cisco CCNP R&S, CCNA Security, and CCNA CyberOps.  
Currently, I hold a Research Engineer position where I try to answer research and innovation questions by leveraging Cloud technologies and the DevOps principles.
