### Superfluidity 
SUPERFLUIDITY is a 5GPPP H2020 project that aims at achieving superfluidity in the Internet: the ability to instantiate services on-the-fly, run them anywhere in the network (core, aggregation, edge) and shift them transparently to different locations.

For more information about the project and its outcomes visit the project's [website](http://superfluidity.eu/).

### NGPaaS
NGPaaS is a 5GPPP H2020 project that aims at redefining the PaaS concept in a modular, composable, customizable (so called built-to-order), easy-to-deploy and update way. The motivation behind it is to give the freedom of designing and deploying a use-case tailored PaaS that may not be available in the predefined catalogs of PaaSes provided by public cloud providers.
